# TransferHub - File Transfer Web App

## Overview
I am **Ayush Aryan**, the developer behind **TransferHub**. This file transfer web app utilizes cutting-edge technologies like **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and real-time communication with **Socket.IO** to provide a seamless experience for file uploads, sharing, and collaboration. My goal was to create an efficient and user-friendly platform that allows users to securely share files, collaborate in real time, and even make secure payments for premium features.

TransferHub is a file transfer web application built using **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Express.js**. The app allows users to upload, share, and collaborate on files in real-time. With advanced features like image compression, file sharing (public and private), TransferHub offers an efficient and scalable solution for file sharing.
